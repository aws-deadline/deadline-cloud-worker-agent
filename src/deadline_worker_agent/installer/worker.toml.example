[worker]

# The unique identifier of the AWS Deadline Cloud farm that the Worker belongs to. This value is overridden
# when the DEADLINE_WORKER_FARM_ID environment variable is set or the --farm-id command-line argument
# is specified.
#
# The following is an example for setting the farm ID in this configuration file:
#
# farm_id = "farm-aabbccddeeff11223344556677889900"
#
# Uncomment the line below and replace the value with your AWS Deadline Cloud farm ID:
#
# farm_id = "REPLACE-WITH-WORKER-FARM-ID"


# The unique identifier of the AWS Deadline Cloud fleet that the Worker belongs to. This value is overridden
# when the DEADLINE_WORKER_FLEET_ID environment variable is set or the --fleet-id command-line
# argument is specified.
#
# The following is an example for setting the fleet ID in this configuration file:
#
# fleet_id = "fleet-aabbccddeeff11223344556677889900"
#
# Uncomment the line below and replace the value with your AWS Deadline Cloud fleet ID:
#
# fleet_id = "REPLACE-WITH-WORKER-FLEET-ID"


# The directory where the worker agent persists its settings and credentials. The persistence directory
# is expected to be located on a file-system that is local to the Worker Host. The Worker's ID
# and credentials are persisted and these should not be accessible by other Workers. This value is overridden
# when the DEADLINE_WORKER_PERSISTENCE_DIR environment variable is set or the --persistence-dir command-line argument
# is specified.
#
# The following is the default worker persistence dir on POSIX systems.
# worker_persistence_dir = "/var/lib/deadline"

[aws]

# The worker agent requires initial AWS credentials in order to bootstrap the worker. Bootstrapping
# the worker consists of two steps:
#
# 1.  Creating a worker resource if one has not been previously created and persisted
#     to /var/lib/deadline/worker.json
# 2.  Obtaining credentials for the worker resource
#
# Once the worker credentials are obtained, those credentials are used and rotated throughout the
# worker agent's lifecycle
#
# By default, the worker agent uses boto3's default credential resolution process to obtain the
# bootstrapping credentials. For details, on this, see
# https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html.
#
# Optionally, the name of an AWS profile can be specified to obtain bootstrapping credentials. For
# an overview of the AWS config file and AWS profiles, see
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html
#
# To use an AWS profile, uncomment the line below and replace with your desired AWS profile name.
# This value is overridden when the DEADLINE_WORKER_PROFILE environment variable is set or if a
# --profile command-line argument is specified.
#
# profile = "my_aws_profile_name"


# The "allow_ec2_instance_profile" setting controls whether the Worker will run with an EC2 instance
# profile associated to the host instance. This value is overridden when the
# DEADLINE_WORKER_ALLOW_INSTANCE_PROFILE environment variable is set using one of the following
# case-insensitive values:
#
#     '0', 'off', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no', '1', 'on', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes'.
#
# or if the --disallow-instance-profile command-line flag is specified.
#
# By default, this value is true and the worker agent will run with or without an instance profile
# if the worker is on an EC2 host. If this value is false, the worker host will query the EC2
# instance meta-data service (IMDS) to check for an instance profile. If an instance profile is
# detected, the worker agent will stop and exit.

[os]

# AWS Deadline Cloud may specify an OS user to run a Job's session actions as. By setting
# "run_jobs_as_agent_user" to true, the specified OS user is ignored and the session actions
# are instead run as the same user that the worker agent process runs as.
#
# This value is overridden when the DEADLINE_WORKER_RUN_JOBS_AS_AGENT_USER environment variable
# is set using one of the following case-insensitive values:
#
#     '0', 'off', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no', '1', 'on', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes'.
#
# or if the --run-jobs-as-agent-user command-line flag is specified.
#
# Uncomment the line below to run all session actions as the same user as the worker agent:
#
# run_jobs_as_agent_user = true

# AWS Deadline Cloud may specify a Posix OS user to run a Job's session actions as. Setting
# "posix_job_user" will override the OS user and the session actions will be run as
# the user given in the value of "posix_job_user" instead. This setting is ignored
# if "run_jobs_as_agent_user" is set to true.
#
# posix_job_user is expressed as a string in the following format:
#
#     '<POSIX_USER>:<POSIX_GROUP>'
#
#   Where:
#
#       <POSIX_USER>
#           An existing posix user that the worker agent has access to
#       <POSIX_GROUP>
#           An existing posix group that the worker agent has access to
#
# To have a specific OS user and group used when running jobs, uncomment the line below and

# environment variable or if the --posix-job-user command-line flag is specified.
#
# posix_job_user = "user:group"

# AWS Deadline Cloud may specify a Windows OS user to run a Job's session actions as. Setting
# "windows_job_user" will override the OS user and the session actions will be run as
# the user given in the value of "windows_job_user" instead. It is important to note that by specifying 
# this value, the password for the Windows OS user specified will be reset to a random, unstored value.
# This setting also requires that the worker agent is run with administrator privileges. This setting is 
# incompatible the setting "run_jobs_as_agent_user" set to true.
#
# To have a specific Windows OS user used when running jobs, uncomment the line below and
# replace the username as desired. This value is overridden when the DEADLINE_WORKER_WINDOWS_JOB_USER
# environment variable or if the --windows-job-user command-line flag is specified.
#
# windows_job_user = "job-user"

# AWS Deadline Cloud may tell the worker to stop. If the "shutdown_on_stop" setting below is true, then the
# Worker will attempt to shutdown the host system after the Worker has been stopped.
#
# This value is overridden when the DEADLINE_WORKER_NO_SHUTDOWN environment variable is set using
# one of the following case-insensitive values:
#
#     '0', 'off', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no', '1', 'on', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes'.

# To prevent the worker agent from shutting down the host when being told to stop, uncomment the
# line below:
#
# shutdown_on_stop = false

# Whether the worker agent should retain the OpenJD Session's working directory on the Session completion.
# This value is overridden when the DEADLINE_WORKER_RETAIN_SESSION_DIR environment variable is set using
# one of the following case-insensitive values:
#
#     '0', 'off', 'f', 'false', 'n', 'no', '1', 'on', 't', 'true', 'y', 'yes'.

[capabilities]

# Capabilities for the Worker can be declared in this config section. There are two types of
# capabilities - amounts and attributes.
#
# The values in the following configuration sections are overridden if the
# DEADLINE_WORKER_CAPABILITIES environment variable is set using a JSON syntax, for example:
#
# {"amounts": { "amount.apples": 12 }, "attributes": { "attr.license_servers": ["green.internal"] }}
#
# For further documentation, see the sections below.

[capabilities.amounts]

# Amount Capabilities
# -------------------
#
#   Amounts represent a capability with a numeric quantity. Amount capabilities are expressed in the
#   config file as:
#
#       "[<VENDOR>:]amount.<NAME>" = <VALUE>
#
#   Where:
#
#       <VENDOR>
#           An optional namespace that indicates the capabilitiy is specific to a particular
#           Open Job Description-compatable render farm management system.
#       <NAME>
#           A name for the amount capability
#       <VALUE>
#           A positive floating-point value which indicates the amount of capability available to
#           the worker.
#
# Examples
# --------
#
# "amount.slots" = 20
# "deadline:amount.pets" = 99

[capabilities.attributes]

#
# Attributes Capabilities
# -------------------
#
#   Attributes represent a capability with a one or more string labels, e.g. major version of a
#   software component. Attribute capabilities are expressed in the config file as:
#
#       "[<VENDOR>:]attr.<NAME>" = [ "<VALUE>", ... ]
#            [...]
#
#   Where:
#
#       <VENDOR>
#           An optional namespace that indicates the capabilitiy is specific to a particular
#           Open Job Description-compatable render farm component.
#       <NAME>
#           A name for the attribute capability
#       <VALUE>
#           One or more string labels
#
# Examples
# --------
#
# "attr.groups" = [
#   "simulation",
#   "maya",
#   "nuke"
# ]
#
# "acmewidgetsco:attr.admins" = [
#   "bob",
#   "alice"
# ]
